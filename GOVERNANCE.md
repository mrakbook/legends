# Governance

## Roles
- **Maintainers**: review PRs, triage issues, cut releases.
- **Contributors**: anyone submitting PRs or participating in discussions.

## Decision Making
- Changes land via PR and at least one maintainer approval.
- Maintainers may merge small/documentation changes with self‑review.

## Release Process
- Merge to `main` via merge commit (no fast‑forward).
- Tag releases semantically (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
