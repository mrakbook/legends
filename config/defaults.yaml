# Identity for backdated commits.
# If left blank, legends will resolve your identity from the authenticated
# GitHub CLI account (`gh api user`). We prefer your verified primary email
# when the token has the `user:email` scope; otherwise we fall back to the
# ID-based noreply address: "<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com".
# (GitHub attributes commits by email, not display name.)
author:
  name: ""    # If empty: GitHub "name" (fallback to login)
  email: ""   # If empty: verified primary email (if available) else ID-based noreply

# Optional: explicitly set committer identity; if blank, defaults to author.*,
# but the CLI will prefer setting committer.name to your GitHub username.
committer:
  name: ""
  email: ""

# Which env var to read a token from when needed (gh usually manages auth itself)
token_env: GITHUB_TOKEN

# Behavior flags
# dry_run is primarily controlled via CLI or environment (GHB_DRY_RUN),
# but you can set a default here if desired.
# dry_run: false
