# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We generally support the latest minor release. Security fixes will be back‑ported on a
best‑effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **email boris@mrakbook.com** with details. We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours.
Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities until a fix is available.

## Disclosure
We'll work with you to triage and fix the issue. Once resolved, we will publish a
security note in the release notes and credit reporters (unless you request otherwise).
